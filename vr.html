      <p>This VR experience is designed to show the importance of having a globally connected society. The experience
      begins with the user in a small room. In the room, the user find furniture one would typically expect to be in a bedroom. As the user
      explores the room, they will notice that they have the ability to interact with the television. When the user turns the TV on,
      they will see a breaking news update about a large earthquake that has just occurred off the coast of Honduras. They will be prompted
      to use the computer to send a warning to their friends.</p>
      <p>When the user interacts with the computer, they will sit down at the desk and will see a computer with an email drafted. The
      email is addressed to a friend (who lives in Honduras), warning them about the event. The user can interact with the send button to send
      the email.</p>
      <p>After sending the email, the user lifts out of the chair, away from Earth and gets a view of the Earth spinning from space. After the
      Earth makes a full rotation, the user will then move back towards earth and will continue moving to Honduras, where they will find themselves
      in a different room. By doing the transition in this way, two things are accomplished. The first being that the user is aware that they are now
      in Honduras. The second, is that this experience should help the user to appreciate the sense of scale involved in the communication.</p>
      <p>Upon entering the new room, the user hears the familiar AOL "You've got mail" sound. This should prompt them to approach the computer. When
      sitting at the computer, the user will see the email that was sent in the previous scene, however, this time they are the recipient. They can
      interact with the reply button, and a drafted reply can be seen. When they press send, the message is sent, and they stand up from the desk. The
      user is then prompted to get to higher ground, and they can interact with the door to leave the room.</p>
      <p>After leaving the room, the user finds themselves in a remote wooded area. They can see water to their right, and mountains to their left.
      If the user strays too close to the water, they will be prompted to get to higher ground. The user then walks towards the mountains. When they
      get close enough, the screen will fade to black and the experience will come to an end.</p>
      <p>This experience should show the user how important global connectivity is. If there was no internet in that part of Honduras, the friend would
      have had no way of knowing about the impending tsunami and would not have known to seek safety in higher ground. There are many places in the world
      that still do not have internet and are not part of our global network. This "digital divide" is harmful to the development of our society and to mankind.  The UN International Telecommunication Union is making efforts to improve Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to bring connectedness and communication to rural areas. With proper infrastructure in place (telephone lines, wireless signals, internet cables, etc.), this digital divide can be reduced and easy communication will be possible to anywhere in the world.  </p>
